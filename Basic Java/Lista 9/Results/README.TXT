In the game your task is to deactivate all blue squares while avoiding direct collision with any of them.

You are the red square and you move on the map by using WASD movements. 

If you collide with any active opponent, you lose.

When one of the blue squares is in direct line with the red square, they will make a charge in it's direction. When the blue square reaches the end of it's charge it will exhaust for a few seconds, presented in the game by darkening it's color. In that time the player can put a bait on a square next to the exhausted opponent, using space button when facing the intended square. When the blue square activates again, it will walk straight into the bait, resulting in it's permament deactivation (gray square). 

Only one bait can be present on the map at the same time. 

The bait can only be put next to an exhausted blue square.

To win deactivate all blue squares.
